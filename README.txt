Open up start_only_eth.bat and replace
(YOUR PUBLIC WALLET ADDRESS).(WORKER NAME)
Get rid of the parenthesis too.  Include "0x" in the
public wallet address

us1.ethermine.org:14444 is the pool this script mines from.
Feel free to change it if you wanna mine from another pool.

You can check the status of your worker on
https://ethermine.org/miners/(YOUR PUBLIC WALLET ADDRESS)
Except don't include the "0x"

Have fun boo
